## BRANCHES ##

git branch -a # lists all branches 
git fetch -p # pulls only current branches by pruning the ones you have locally

git checkout -b branch origin/branch #checks out remote and creates local branch

git branch -d or -D branch # delete local branch -D forces deletion of unmerged branch
git push origin -d branch # deletes remote branch named branch
git branch -dr origin/branch # deletes the local remote-tracking branch -r=remote

## ADD ##

git add . # adds all changes to staging or -A flag
git rm --cached . -r # will unstage all added files recursively
git add file.txt
git rm --cached file.txt # will remove single file from staging 

## COMMIT ##

git commit -m "message"
git commit --amend # amends last commit message

## PUSH ##

git push -u origin branch #first push will sync with a remote branch ie. set upstream 
git push # after setting upstream you only need this and it will push to remote branch

# Merge
# Switch to branch you want to merge with another

git checkout -b branch origin/branch # creates a local branch and tracks remote branch if you are not tracking it
git checkout branch # if you are already tracking the branch just check it out
git merge test # will merge with the changes made in test branch
 
## TAGS ##

git tag -a v1.1 -m "release 1.1"
git show v1.1 # shows info for tag
git checkout v1.1 

# Rebase, used when there are updates to master that you want to intake
#DO NOT REBASE ON A SHARED BRANCH

# create and checkout a branch
# create commits on your branch
git rebase master # pulls in changes from master

## DIFF ##

git diff
git diff HEAD # prints difference of your current changes vs latest commit can add /path/file to check a file at the end as well 
git diff <hash-value>
git diff master
git diff <branch-name> <branch-name> # compares differences in two branches 

## RESET ##

git reset --hard <hash> # puts you on a specific commit and deletes your current changes
 

## WORKFLOW ##

EXPLANATION:
	# you will need to create a git repo or clone a repo to start a project
	# git init will initiate a project you already started, create a repo in github and follow their commands to push to that repo
	# you should push to master initially and from then on create branches to make updates and merge to master
COMMANDS:
        git init
	git clone https://url

EXPLANATION:
	# git fetch -p will prune your branches and show the remote branches available (origin/branch), 
	# create a local branch with the same name as the remote, omitting the "origin" part
	# make desired changes and push using -u flag to sync local branch to remote branch and only needed the first time you push
	# remember that you will be working on the same branch as someone else and may cause merge conflicts 

COMMANDS:
	Branch already created- 
	git fetch -p, git checkout -b branch origin/branch, git pull, make changes, 
	git add ., git commit -m "message", git push -u origin branch

EXPLANATION:
	# if you have to create a branch for your task follow below procedure, providing your branch name after the -b 

COMMANDS:
	Branch not created- git checkout -b branch, make changes, git add ., git commit -m "message", git push -u origin branch

EXPLANATION:
	# Someone has already done work on their branch and you want to continue but you want your own branch. 
	# When you checkout, create a branch that matches their named branch

COMMANDS:
	Checkout a team members branch and create your own based off theirs- 
	git fetch -p, git checkout -b branch origin/branch, git pull, git checkout -b newbranch, make changes, 
	git add ., git commit -m "message", git push -u origin newbranch 

######################################################################################################################

After pushing changes, create a pull request to merge into master and notify team members 

Delete branches that are no longer needed locally and remote using above commands 

# This is something that makes things easier for me when working with git
# add the lines below to your .bash_profile on mac then (source .bash_profile)
# alias gitlog='git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph' 
# alias git-help='cat /Users/username/git/git-help' # put this file in a path and create an alias git-help and call it to help in git
